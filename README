This directory contains the student distribution of the Y86-64 tools.  It
is a proper subset of the master distribution, minus the solution
files found in the master distribution.

yas		Y86-64 assembler
yis		Y86-64 instruction (ISA) simulator 
ssim		SEQ simulator
psim		PIPE simulator

1. Building the Y86-64 tools
*************************

The Y86-64 simulators can be configured to support TTY
interfaces. A simulator running in TTY mode prints all information
about its run-time behavior on the terminal.  It's harder to understand what's
going on, but useful for automated testing, and doesn't require any
special installation features.

To build the Y86-64 tools, perform the following steps:

unix> make clean; make

Makefile
	Builds the Y86-64 tools

README
	This file

misc/	
	Source files for the Y86-64 assembler yas, the Y86-64 instruction
	simulator yis, and the isa.c file that is used by the -t option
	of the processor simulators to check the results against the
	ISA simulation.

seq/	
	Code for the SEQ simulator. You will need to modify ssim.c.

pipe/	
	Code for the PIPE simulator. You will need to modify psim.c.

cache/	
	Code for the CACHE simulator. You will need to modify cache.c.

pipe-cache/	
	Code for the PIPE with CACHE simulator. You will need to modify cache.c and pcsim.c.

y86-code/
	Example .ys files from CS:APP and scripts for conducting
	automated benchmark teseting of the new processor designs.

ptest/
	Automated regression testing scripts for testing processor designs.
