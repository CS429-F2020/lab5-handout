This directory contains the code to construct simulators for PIPE and
the variants of it described in the homework exercises.

*************************
1. Building the simulator
*************************

The Makefile can be configured to build simulators that support 
TTY interfaces. A simulator running in TTY mode prints all
information about its runtime behavior on the terminal.  It's hard to
understand what's going on, but useful for automated testing, and
doesn't require any special installation features.

unix> make clean; make

***********************
2. Using the simulators
***********************

The simulator recognizes the following command line arguments:

Usage: pcsim [-ht] [-l m] [-v n] file.yo

   -h     Print this message
   -l m   Set instruction limit to m [TTY mode only] (default 10000)
   -v n   Set verbosity level to 0 <= n <= 2 [TTY mode only] (default 2)
   -t     Test result against the ISA simulator (yis) [TTY model only]
